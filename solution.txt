Here is the original list: 2 -> 8 -> 2 -> 2 -> 31 -> 18 -> 23 -> 2

This list contains 8 number of items 

Counting Even Function in Main...
 === Counting the Doubly Linked List EVEN nodes
2
Counting 1 even. 
 === Counting the Doubly Linked List EVEN nodes
8
Counting 2 even. 
 === Counting the Doubly Linked List EVEN nodes
2
Counting 3 even. 
 === Counting the Doubly Linked List EVEN nodes
2
Counting 4 even. 
 === Counting the Doubly Linked List EVEN nodes
31
Counting 4 even. 
 === Counting the Doubly Linked List EVEN nodes
18
Counting 5 even. 
 === Counting the Doubly Linked List EVEN nodes
23
Counting 5 even. 
 === Counting the Doubly Linked List EVEN nodes
2
Counting 6 even. 
=== Finished Counting
6

Removing the all even nodes
Removing 2 even. 
Removing 8 even. 
Removing 2 even. 
Removing 2 even. 
Removing 18 even. 
Removing 2 even. 
=== Finished Removing6 Even Nodes
6 removed 


The resulting list is... 31 -> 23


Now backwards: 23 -> 31

This list contains 2 number of items 
The sum of all data is: 54
