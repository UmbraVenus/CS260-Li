Data file (2, one for line, one for promotional)

Customer(Group)
    ==> Class with Information
Individual
    ==> Class with Information

Line/Queue 
    ==> Circular Linked List

    Group 
        ==> Node
            = name of the group
            = number of people in group
            = accomodation? (wheel chair or kiddie chair)
            = bool of if the group would like to receive promotional materials
        
Stack 
    ==> Array
        = name/email address

Queue: (Circular Linked List)

Enqueue(add at the back), 
Dequeue(delete at front), 
peek(next group), 
display(get size)

Stack: (Array)
push(when they are seated), 
pop (then saved to a data file), 
peek, 
display(get size),

Menu, this time I am not going to complicate the app by promoting in app.cpp. Instead I will move the prompt to the implementation of stack and queue
    = load queue
    = Display Queue

1. Add group to queue.
    = Enqueue
    
2. Seat the front queue and get interest in promotions.
    = Dequeue
    = If interested in promotion
        => add to stack
    = If not interested
    
3. Peek the information of next group.
    = Peek

4. Display the number of waiting groups
    = getSize

5. Handing out promotional materials.
    = display stack.txt
    = Pop in stack
    = save to contacted.txt

6. Display all customers contacted for promotions.
    = load from contacted.txt
    = display contacted.txt
